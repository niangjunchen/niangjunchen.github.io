			Due to mainstream adoption of cloud computing and its rapidly increasing usage of energy, the efficient management of cloud computing resources has become an important issue. A key challenge in managing the resources lies in the volatility of their demand. While there have been a wide variety of online algorithms (e.g. Receding Horizon Control, Online Balanced Descent) designed, it is hard for cloud operators to pick the right algorithm. In particular, these algorithms vary greatly on their usage of predictions and performance guarantees. This paper aims at studying an automatic algorithm selection scheme in real time. To do this, we empirically study the prediction errors from real-world cloud computing traces. Results show that prediction errors are distinct from different prediction algorithms, across virtual machines, and over the time horizon. Based on these observations, we propose a simple prediction error model and prove upper bounds on the dynamic regret of several online algorithms. We then apply the empirical and theoretical results to create a simple online meta-algorithm that chooses the best algorithm on the fly. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the performance of the designed policy is close to that of the best algorithm in hindsight.

			We study Smoothed Online Convex Optimization, a version of online convex optimization where the learner incurs a penalty for changing her actions between rounds. Given a known Ω(\sqrt{d}) lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm, where d is the dimension of the action space, we ask under what conditions this bound can be beaten. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework for this problem, Online Balanced Descent (OBD), which works by iteratively projecting the previous point onto a carefully chosen level set of the current cost function so as to balance the switching costs and hitting costs. We demonstrate the generality of the OBD framework by showing how, with different choices of "balance," OBD can improve upon state-of-the-art performance guarantees for both competitive ratio and regret; in particular, OBD is the first algorithm to achieve a dimension-free competitive ratio, 3+O(1/α), for locally polyhedral costs, where α measures the "steepness" of the costs. We also prove bounds on the dynamic regret of OBD when the balance is performed in the dual space that are dimension-free and imply that OBD has sublinear static regret.

			Many real-world control systems, such as the smart grid and human sensorimotor control systems, have decentralized components that react quickly using local infor- mation and centralized components that react slowly using a more global view. This paper seeks to provide a theoretical framework for how to design controllers that are decomposed across timescales in this way. The framework is analogous to how the network utility maximization framework uses opti- mization decomposition to distribute a global control problem across independent controllers, each of which solves a local problem; except our goal is to decompose a global problem temporally, extracting a timescale separation. Our results highlight that decomposition of a multi-timescale controller into a fast timescale, reactive controller and a slow timescale, predictive controller can be near-optimal in a strong sense. In particular, we exhibit such a design, named Multi-timescale Reflexive Predictive Control (MRPC), which maintains a per- timestep cost within a constant factor of the offline optimal in an adversarial setting.

			We formulate EV charging as a feasibility problem that meets all EVs’ energy demands before departure under charging rate con- straints and total power constraint. We propose an online algorithm, the smoothed least-laxity- rst (sLLF) algorithm, that decides on the current charging rates based on only the information up to the current time. We characterize the performance of the sLLF algorithm analytically and numerically. Numerical experiments with real-world data show that it has signi cantly higher rate of generating feasible EV charging than several other common EV charging algorithms.

		We consider online convex optimization (OCO) problems with switching costs and noisy predictions. While the design of online algorithms for OCO problems has received considerable attention, the design of algorithms in the context of noisy predictions is largely open.  To this point, two promising algorithms have been proposed: Receding Horizon Control (RHC) and Averaging Fixed Horizon Control (AFHC).  The comparison of these policies is largely open.
		AFHC has been shown to provide better worst-case performance, while RHC outperforms AFHC in many realistic settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of policies, Committed Horizon Control (CHC), that generalizes both RHC and AFHC.  We provide average-case analysis and concentration results for CHC policies, yielding the first analysis of RHC for OCO problems with noisy predictions.  Further, we provide explicit results characterizing the optimal CHC policy as a function of properties of the prediction noise, e.g., variance and correlation structure.  Our results provide a characterization of when AFHC outperforms RHC and vice versa, as well as when other CHC policies outperform both RHC and AFHC.

			Data centers have emerged as promising resources for demand response, particularly for
			emergency demand response (EDR), which saves the power grid from incurring blackouts
			during emergency situations. However, currently, data centers typically participate in EDR
			by turning on backup (diesel) generators, which is both expensive and environmentally
			unfriendly. In this paper, we focus on ‘‘greening’’ demand response in multi-tenant data
			centers, i.e., colocation data centers, by designing a pricing mechanism through which the
			data center operator can efficiently extract load reductions from tenants during emergency
			periods for EDR. In particular, we propose a pricing mechanism for both mandatory and
			voluntary EDR programs, ColoEDR, that is based on parameterized supply function bidding
			and provides provably near-optimal efficiency guarantees, both when tenants are pricetaking
			and when they are price-anticipating. In addition to analytic results, we extend the
			literature on supply function mechanism design, and evaluate ColoEDR using trace-based
			simulation studies. These validate the efficiency analysis and conclude that the pricing
			mechanism is both beneficial to the environment and to the data center operator (by
			decreasing the need for backup diesel generation), while also aiding tenants (by providing
			payments for load reductions).

			Demand response is a crucial aspect of the future smart grid. It has the potential to provide significant peak demand reduction
			and to ease the incorporation of renewable energy into the grid. Data centers’ participation in demand response is becoming
			increasingly important given their high and increasing energy consumption and their flexibility in demand management compared
			to conventional industrial facilities. In this paper, we study two demand response schemes to reduce a data center’s peak loads
			and energy expenditure: workload shifting and the use of local power generation. We conduct a detailed characterization study
			of coincident peak data over two decades from Fort Collins Utilities, Colorado and then develop two algorithms for data centers
			by combining workload scheduling and local power generation to avoid the coincident peak and reduce the energy expenditure.
			The first algorithm optimizes the expected cost and the second one provides a good worst-case guarantee for any coincident peak
			pattern, workload demand and renewable generation prediction error distributions. We evaluate these algorithms via numerical
			simulations based on real world traces from production systems. The results show that using workload shifting in combination
			with local generation can provide significant cost savings (up to 40% under the Fort Collins Utilities charging scheme) compared
			to either alone.

			Real-time demand response is an essential tool for handling
			the uncertainties associated with the increasing penetration
			of renewable generation. Traditionally, demand response has
			been focused on large industrial and commercial loads, however
			it is expected that a large number of small residential
			loads such as air conditioners, dish washers, and electric vehicles
			will also participate in the coming years. The electricity
			consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable

			(in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in
			renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time
			distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the
			variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation)
			by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads
			to periods with high renewable generation. At every time
			step, the algorithm minimizes the expected aggregate load
