		We consider online convex optimization (OCO) problems with switching costs and noisy predictions. While the design of online algorithms for OCO problems has received considerable attention, the design of algorithms in the context of noisy predictions is largely open.  To this point, two promising algorithms have been proposed: Receding Horizon Control (RHC) and Averaging Fixed Horizon Control (AFHC).  The comparison of these policies is largely open.
		AFHC has been shown to provide better worst-case performance, while RHC outperforms AFHC in many realistic settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of policies, Committed Horizon Control (CHC), that generalizes both RHC and AFHC.  We provide average-case analysis and concentration results for CHC policies, yielding the first analysis of RHC for OCO problems with noisy predictions.  Further, we provide explicit results characterizing the optimal CHC policy as a function of properties of the prediction noise, e.g., variance and correlation structure.  Our results provide a characterization of when AFHC outperforms RHC and vice versa, as well as when other CHC policies outperform both RHC and AFHC.

			Aggregators are playing an increasingly crucial role for integrating
			renewable generation into power systems. However,
			the intermittent nature of renewable generation makes
			market interactions of aggregators difficult to monitor and
			regulate, raising concerns about potential market manipulations.
			In this paper, we address this issue by quantifying
			the profit an aggregator can obtain through strategic curtailment
			of generation in an electricity market. We show
			that, while the problem of maximizing the benefit from curtailment
			is hard in general, efficient algorithms exist when
			the topology of the network is radial (acyclic). Further, we
			highlight that significant increases in profit can be obtained
			through strategic curtailment in practical settings.

			Data centers have emerged as promising resources for demand response, particularly for
			emergency demand response (EDR), which saves the power grid from incurring blackouts
			during emergency situations. However, currently, data centers typically participate in EDR
			by turning on backup (diesel) generators, which is both expensive and environmentally
			unfriendly. In this paper, we focus on ‘‘greening’’ demand response in multi-tenant data
			centers, i.e., colocation data centers, by designing a pricing mechanism through which the
			data center operator can efficiently extract load reductions from tenants during emergency
			periods for EDR. In particular, we propose a pricing mechanism for both mandatory and
			voluntary EDR programs, ColoEDR, that is based on parameterized supply function bidding
			and provides provably near-optimal efficiency guarantees, both when tenants are pricetaking
			and when they are price-anticipating. In addition to analytic results, we extend the
			literature on supply function mechanism design, and evaluate ColoEDR using trace-based
			simulation studies. These validate the efficiency analysis and conclude that the pricing
			mechanism is both beneficial to the environment and to the data center operator (by
			decreasing the need for backup diesel generation), while also aiding tenants (by providing
			payments for load reductions).

			Making use of predictions is a crucial, but under-explored,
			area of online algorithms. This paper studies a class of online
			optimization problems where we have external noisy
			predictions available. We propose a stochastic prediction
			error model that generalizes prior models in the learning
			and stochastic control communities, incorporates correlation
			among prediction errors, and captures the fact that predictions
			improve as time passes. We prove that achieving sublinear
			regret and constant competitive ratio for online algorithms
			requires the use of an unbounded prediction window
			in adversarial settings, but that under more realistic stochastic
			prediction error models it is possible to use Averaging
			Fixed Horizon Control (AFHC) to simultaneously achieve
			sublinear regret and constant competitive ratio in expectation
			using only a constant-sized prediction window. Furthermore,
			we show that the performance of AFHC is tightly
			concentrated around its mean.

			Electric vehicles (EVs) offer an attractive long-term

			Demand response is a crucial aspect of the future smart grid. It has the potential to provide significant peak demand reduction
			and to ease the incorporation of renewable energy into the grid. Data centers’ participation in demand response is becoming
			increasingly important given their high and increasing energy consumption and their flexibility in demand management compared
			to conventional industrial facilities. In this paper, we study two demand response schemes to reduce a data center’s peak loads
			and energy expenditure: workload shifting and the use of local power generation. We conduct a detailed characterization study
			of coincident peak data over two decades from Fort Collins Utilities, Colorado and then develop two algorithms for data centers
			by combining workload scheduling and local power generation to avoid the coincident peak and reduce the energy expenditure.
			The first algorithm optimizes the expected cost and the second one provides a good worst-case guarantee for any coincident peak
			pattern, workload demand and renewable generation prediction error distributions. We evaluate these algorithms via numerical
			simulations based on real world traces from production systems. The results show that using workload shifting in combination
			with local generation can provide significant cost savings (up to 40% under the Fort Collins Utilities charging scheme) compared
			to either alone.

			Real-time demand response is an essential tool for handling
			the uncertainties associated with the increasing penetration
			of renewable generation. Traditionally, demand response has
			been focused on large industrial and commercial loads, however
			it is expected that a large number of small residential
			loads such as air conditioners, dish washers, and electric vehicles
			will also participate in the coming years. The electricity
			consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable
			loads, can be shifted over time, and can thus be used
			(in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in
			renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time
			distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the
			variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation)
			by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads
			to periods with high renewable generation. At every time
			step, the algorithm minimizes the expected aggregate load
			variance with updated predictions. We prove that the suboptimality
			of the algorithm vanishes quickly as time horizon
			expands. Further, we evaluate the algorithm via trace-based
			simulations.

			Electric vehicles (EVs) offer an attractive long-term
			solution to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel and greenhouse
			gas emission. However, a fleet of EVs with different EV battery
			charging rate constraints, that is distributed across a smart
			power grid network requires a coordinated charging schedule
			to minimize the power generation and EV charging costs. In
			this paper, we study a joint optimal power flow (OPF) and EV
			charging problem that augments the OPF problem with charging
			EVs over time. While the OPF problem is generally nonconvex
			and nonsmooth, it is shown recently that the OPF problem can be
			solved optimally for most practical power grid networks using its
			convex dual problem. Building on this strong duality result, we
			study a nested optimization approach to decompose the joint OPF
